    "This notebook is built on code from the helpers file. I've put together a small story based on expected outcomes depending on current day dollars invested and annually recurring investments. Default values are based on articles cited here or in the helpers file, but feel free to use numbers that make more sense for you! I will note that annual percentage growth is nominal by default; if you prefer real returns you may want to set percentages to 0.068 as per this article: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-strategy-and-corporate-finance-blog/markets-will-be-markets-an-analysis-of-long-term-returns-from-the-s-and-p-500"
